        Hi! I’m Katherine. I’m a PhD student at UIUC studying Computer Science Education, but my path here has been a bit winding. I originally studied biology, but a required CS course showed me where my interests truly lay. Since then, I’ve explored bioinformatics research and formal methods research until finding my way back to my truest joy: teaching. I enjoy research ways to improve student experiences in theory classrooms. Most importantly, I love working with students, encouraging them, and helping them feel comfortable as they tackle challenging concepts. 
        
        This semester, I’m a TA for algorithms and also help run a TA training seminar. Over the summer, I taught 8th grade girls at a CS+X summer camp, experimenting with ways to make computer science exciting and showing how it applies to all sorts of careers and interests. My teaching philosophy comes from my first CS class. When I struggled to understand the material, I realized how much a patient explanation and encouragement can make a difference. I also draw inspiration from Bell Hooks’ Teaching to Transgress and the ideas behind compassionate pedagogy. I continue to learn and stay informed so that I can meet my teaching goal with all students: making sure everyone feels they can get something out of the lesson and that they belong.
        
        In my research, I focus on student experience. I study how students learn, where they get stuck, and how instructional practices can make learning more equitable and engaging. Right now, I’m building a tool to generate personalized problems, and separately, I’m investigating potential barriers to learning in algorithms. In the past, I’ve explored student motivation and why formal methods sometimes fail to spark excitement.
        
        Beyond the classroom and lab, I love giving back to my community. I’ve run outreach programs introducing younger students to computing and helping with scholarship applications. I also enjoy spending time outdoors and frequently volunteer with my local parks department, which hosts free community events. When I’m inside, you’ll probably find me at the public library hunting for new books or cuddled up with my cat Tashi, reading them. I have also enjoyed working as an election judge for both local and federal elections.

            During my undergraduate years, I worked on Bioinformatics research. Under Professor David Fernandz-Baca, I contributed to the paper "Checking Phylogenetics Decisiveness in Theory and in Practice." 
            My contribution included formulating an ILP version of a hypergraph coloring problem, programming both the SAT and ILP problem formulations and developing data reduction strategies.
            
            At Iowa State, I also developed a passion for teaching. There, I TA'ed for an advanced C programming class, guiding students through a semester long project. For three semesters, I was a TA for Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms. In this role, I taught a weekly discussion section, held office hours, and graded student work. These experiences were the most enjoyable of my time in college and led me to apply for a PhD.
