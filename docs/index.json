When I first proposed this topic, I was only thinking about what we can do as TAs when teaching. However, as I reserached, I discovered that this is more a pedagogical approach, which is different from teaching in that pedagogy is the theory and practice of teaching (including methods, approaches, etc) and teaching is just the act of teaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"strategies\"\u003eStrategies:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, I have shared a list of compassionate teaching strategies that may be useful to a TA. These come from the review paper, “Compassionate pedagogy in higher education: A scoping review” by Dr Clare Killingbacka, Amy Tomlinsona, and Professor Julian Sternb (2024). This review paper compiled information from most peer-reviewed papers on compassionate pedagogy to create this list. While there are many ways to practice compassionate pedagogy at an institution or program level, the lists below are strategies that may be helpful as a TA/instructor.
