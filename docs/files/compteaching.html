<h1 id="compassion">Compassion</h1>
<p>Compassion can be define as a four stage process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Noticing the suffering is present  </li>
<li>Making meaning of the suffering in order to create the desire to alleviate it  </li>
<li>Feeling empathic concern for those who are experiencing the suffering  </li>
<li>Acting to alleviate the suffering to some extent at least</li>
</ol>
<p>(Worline &amp; Dutton, 2017) (Parattukudi, 2019)</p>
<h1 id="compassionate-pedagogy">Compassionate Pedagogy</h1>
<p>Compassionate pedagogy requires the following four actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A noticing of suffering, distress, or disadvantage   </li>
<li>A commitment to address or mitigate the suffering, distress, or disadvantage   </li>
<li>The promotion of wellbeing and flourishing   </li>
<li>A concern for the whole student as a person</li>
</ol>
<p>(Killingback et al., 2025)</p>
<p>What is pedagogy? Pedagogy is “the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.” </p>
<p>You may notice that I switch between the words pedagogy and teaching. When I first proposed this topic, I was only thinking about what we can do as TAs when teaching. However, as I reserached, I discovered that this is more a pedagogical approach, which is different from teaching in that pedagogy is the theory and practice of teaching (including methods, approaches, etc) and teaching is just the act of teaching. </p>
<h1 id="strategies-">Strategies:</h1>
<p>Below, I have shared a list of compassionate teaching strategies that may be useful to a TA. These come from the review paper, “Compassionate pedagogy in higher education: A scoping review” by Dr Clare Killingbacka, Amy Tomlinsona, and Professor Julian Sternb (2024). This review paper compiled information from most peer-reviewed papers on compassionate pedagogy to create this list. While there are many ways to practice compassionate pedagogy at an institution or program level, the lists below are strategies that may be helpful as a TA/instructor. I have first highlighted several that may be most useful to TAs with a limited role in course policy/set up. </p>
